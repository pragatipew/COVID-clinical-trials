# COVID-clinical-trials
This dashboard is an interactive and comprehensive overview of clinical trials related to COVID-19. It is designed for researchers, healthcare professionals, or public health analysts to explore key metrics and trends in a user-friendly way.

Key Data and Metrics
The dashboard likely includes visualizations and data points related to:

1. Trial Statistics: The total number of trials, the number of active, completed, or suspended trials, and the distribution of trials by phase (e.g., Phase 1, 2, 3). 

2. Geographic Distribution: A map visualization showing the number of trials by country or region, allowing for a geographic analysis of where research is being conducted.
  
3. Intervention Types: Breakdowns of trials by the type of intervention, such as vaccines, antivirals, or other therapeutic treatments.
  
4. Sponsor Information: Details on the organizations funding the trials, including pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, or government bodies.

Interactive Features
The dashboard is built with interactivity in mind, allowing users to:
1. Filter Data: Use slicers to filter the data by various categories, such as trial status (e.g., "Recruiting," "Completed"), date ranges, or specific countries.

2.  Drill Down: Explore detailed information by clicking on a specific data point, such as a country on the map or a bar on a chart, to see the individual trials within that category.
 
3. Visualize Trends: Analyze trends over time with line charts that show the start and completion dates of trials.

Potential Use Cases
This dashboard would be a valuable tool for:
1. Research Analysis: Quickly identifying the current state of COVID-19 research, including which treatments are most studied and which regions are leading the effort.

2. Strategic Planning: Helping organizations make informed decisions about resource allocation and potential partnerships in the global fight against the pandemic.
 
3. Public Reporting: Providing a transparent and easy-to-understand view of clinical trial progress to the public and other stakeholders.
